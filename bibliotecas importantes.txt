(implicitly) because it is all the basic ones (String, Integer, Double, etc)

java.util contains all your data structures you learned in school and more.

java.io for file reading. Look into java.util.Scanner for simple file reading, but
for any more complicated, low level file reading info, use java.io, its built for efficiency, while Scanner is for simplicity

java.math if you ever need to use arbitrary precision values

java.net for sockets, connections, etc

javax.swing for GUI, which is an extension of the older java.awt
